## Introduction

Mejbaan is a project developed for the Global NGO Executive Committee (GNEC) hackathon with a mission to address the critical issue of food wastage and hunger in the world. More than one-third of all food produced is wasted, while millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition every day. This web app aims to bridge this gap by creating a platform where individuals can share their surplus food items, and NGOs or volunteers can collect and distribute the food to those in need.

## Problem Statement

Approximately 2.5 billion tonnes of food are wasted annually, while around 828 million people suffer from hunger on a daily basis. The Mejbaan project tackles this issue by providing a user-friendly platform for surplus food sharing, enabling people to make a meaningful impact in their communities.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in securely to their accounts, ensuring a personalized experience.

- **Surplus Food Listing**: Users can list the surplus food items they wish to donate. They can provide details such as the type of food, quantity, and expiry date (if applicable).

- **Location-based Search**: Mejbaan uses GPS/Location Services to provide accurate locations and distances between food donors and potential recipients.

  - JavaScript
  - React.js
